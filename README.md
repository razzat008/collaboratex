# gollaboratex
        lets try writing a LaTeX that allows: collaboration + editing of LaTeX

## How we plan on approaching this
- we'll be focused more on implementing the backend for this project
    - handling users
    - compiling latex
    - functionality
    - authentication
## Tech stack(probably)
- Go | `gin` for backend
- TypeScript | `react` for frontend
- Haven't thought about database
---
I plan to finish this project by the time I graduate. Let's see how it goes.
